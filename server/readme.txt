this game has a client/server architecture.

the server stores all the data of the game,
the client makes the human user interact with the server.

the client is mostly GUI and frontend, while the server
stores data and validates user requests.
Therefore, the client is pure HTML/frontend,
while the client needs the ability to accept requests and process them.
==> LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP).
