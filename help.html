<p>
This is not a jump-n-run game.
W,A,S,D do nothing. Don't even try.
</p>

<p>
This game is centered on story-telling and
adventure. However, there is no speed-target.
It is <b>you</b> who progresses through the game,
not the game that progresses.
As you move through the game, you gain experience.
However, you do so not in some in-game currency,
but in your actual world.

<p>
A lot of the icons are clickable. Try randomly clicking on stuff.

If you're ever stuck, you can navigate with the browser navigation (back button) or with the overlaying menu on the top right corner of the screen.
