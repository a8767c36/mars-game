<!--
solar panels vs plants:
all calculations on inos.
solar irradiation is 1000 W/m²
solar panels give 200 W/m².
plants give 7500 kg/10 000 m²/year.
that is 750 g/m²/year.
that is 12 MJ/m²/year.
that is 32 kJ/day.
that is 0.38 J/s.
that is 0.38 W of power.
that is ~1/1000 the efficiency of solar panels.
