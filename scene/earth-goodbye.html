<h1>Earth - Saying Goodbye</h1>
Interviewer: So you've decided to leave your old life behind, just to start a new life on Mars. Are you sure about that?

You: I've been thinking about this for 20 years. It is my dream.

Interviewer: Okay then, you will have to go through the standard astronaut training procedure. You require physical health to go on this journey. On top of that, you will have to pay for the transport and stuff you will need.

---

You: When do we launch?

Rocket Company: Tomorrow morning. The weather is clear and the window is open.

---

You: So this is it.
