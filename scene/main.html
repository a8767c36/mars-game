this is becoming a mars exploration game.

you can navigate around with the mouse, get to different locations and change scenes.

the game world is a network of connected spaces.
you can go from one space to the next by clicking on a button that connects you to the next space.
there is a concept of adjacent spaces.
scenes must load up fast, so that scene changes are seamless.

ideally, scene changes are near-real time.
