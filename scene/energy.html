All of the energy for industry must eventually come from the sun.<br>
The most direct (and most efficient) way to do this is by solar panels.<br><br>

Currently installed solar panels: <span id="count"></span><br>
<!-- (look at the map and count how many are solar panels)<br><br> -->

<div id="container">
	<img src="/scene/energy.png">
</div>

<style>

html, body, #scene {
	height: 100%;
	margin: 0;
	overflow: auto;
}

#container {
	display: flex;
	justify-content: center;
}

img {
	background: white;
}

</style>
